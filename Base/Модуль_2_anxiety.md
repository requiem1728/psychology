## Overview

Disorders that have as their central organizing theme the emotional state of fear, worry, or excessive apprehension that negatively impacts a person‚Äôs life‚Äî**anxiety disorders**‚Äîare the most common psychological disorders in the world (Yang et al., 2021). A recent study found more than 300 million cases of anxiety disorders worldwide (Yang et al., 2021). Studies within the United States have shown that during the COVID-19 pandemic, prevalence of anxiety disorders was as high as 30% (Twenge & Joiner, 2020). **Prevalence** of anxiety disorders (the total number or percentage of cases of a disease or disorder existing in a population) during the COVID-19 pandemic for adolescents ranged as high as 20% (Racine et al., 2021). For some groups of people, though, prevalence rates are much higher. Global prevalence rates for medical students have been estimated at 34%, and those of health care workers have ranged from 22% to 33% (Fernandez et al., 2021; Quek et al., 2019).

Despite the fact that anxiety disorders are commonplace, they are not always easy to recognize, even when we are the one experiencing them. As an example, consider the case of Meredith Arthur. Meredith was suffering from migraines, severe neck pain, and bouts of dizziness. When she was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)‚Äîa disorder characterized by near-constant worrying‚Äîshe was initially surprised because she didn‚Äôt consider herself to be a worrier or an anxious person. But, after reading online reports of other people‚Äôs experiences with GAD, she realized that her self-described tendency to overthink everything was actually a result of her constant worrying (Arthur, 2016).

The point is not that anxiety is subtle; typically it is not. Rather, anxiety looks different in different people. For people with phobias, anxiety shows itself as easily recognizable fears. People with panic disorder, on the other hand, often mistake the physiological arousal that comes with their anxiety as a heart attack. Others, like Meredith who have GAD, end up focusing on the results of the anxiety (in her case, overthinking) instead of the worrying itself. Still others experience their anxiety mostly in the form of physical symptoms such as pain, sleep disruption, or digestive ailments such as irritable bowel syndrome (Lee et al., 2018).

A closer look at the data reveals that anxiety disorders impact groups unevenly when you consider demographic factors such as gender, conflict status, and economic status. The figure ‚ÄúDemographic Factors Impacting Prevalence‚Äù shows that women are twice as likely as men to report suffering from anxiety, and people living in regions that experience war and civil unrest (conflict) report greater prevalence of anxiety than those in non-conflict regions. Interestingly, there is greater prevalence of anxiety disorders in countries with higher incomes (Baxter et al., 2012; Global Burden of Disease Collaborative Network, 2020).

### _Demographic Factors Impacting Prevalence_

_Note_. Three horizontal bar graphs showing prevalence rates of anxiety based on the demographic factors of gender, conflict status, and economic income status. For gender, males have a prevalence rate of 4.70% and women 9.90%. For Conflict status, non-conflict areas have a prevalence rate of 5.60% and conflict areas have a prevalence rate of 9.00%. For economic income status, low income has a prevalence rate of 3.37%, low middle income 3.40%, upper middle income 4.36%, and high income 5.52%.

Although discussions about anxiety often focus on its negative aspects, anxiety itself is not always a problem. On the contrary, anxiety is helpful in many situations. It can indicate that we care about something, motivate us to act when we otherwise might not, and warn us when we are in danger. The routine anxiety that people experience every day becomes a component of an anxiety disorder, however, when it becomes overly frequent or overly distressing, when the person experiencing it cannot find effective ways to manage it, and when it begins to interfere with the person‚Äôs life.

# The Influence of Culture on Anxiety Prevalence

## Overview

**Culture** is the distinctive customs, values, beliefs, knowledge, art, and language of a society or a community that are the basis for everyday behaviors and practices, passed on from generation to generation, sometimes overtly but often implicitly. Or, put more simply, culture is an umbrella term for the societal norms and expectations that guide individual behavior. In addition, culture is dynamic and ever changing, and cultural change is bidirectional. That is, people both affect and are affected by their culture. Overall, culture emerges from daily life and interactions between people (L√≥pez & Guarnaccia, 2016).

As you might expect, the prevalence rates, symptoms, and expression of a psychological disorder vary across cultures as do diagnostic trends, treatment protocols, and likelihood of a successful recovery. Some of the differences in expression of a disorder are based on people‚Äôs responses to societal expectations and some of the diagnostic and treatment differences result from biases on the part of clinicians (Causadias & Cicchetti, 2018).

Anxiety disorders can also be manifested differently in different cultures (Hofmann & Hinton, 2014; Hoge et al., 2006). For example, patients from Nepal who had GAD experienced more physical symptoms, such as¬† indigestion and dizziness, than patients from the United States, who experienced more psychological symptoms, including¬† fear and nervousness (Hoge et al., 2006). Panic attacks that produce fears of a heart attack in patients in the United States are experienced as ‚Äúwind attacks‚Äù in Cambodian patients who fear dysfunctional ‚Äúinner wind‚Äù and blood flow (Hofmann & Hinton, 2014).

A person‚Äôs culture can influence the experience of anxiety even within one multicultural country (Hofmann & Hinton, 2014). Within the United States, Asian Americans report fewer symptoms of anxiety disorders than do African Americans and Latino/a Americans (Asnaani et al., 2010). Further, White Americans consistently report experiencing more symptoms of anxiety disorders than African-, Asian-, or Latino/a-Americans (Asnaani et al., 2010).

¬†The figure "Prevalence Rates of Anxiety Disorders based on Cultural Background‚Äù reveals that predominantly European/Anglo cultures have higher prevalence rates of anxiety disorders than other cultures. By contrast, African and Indo/Asian cultures report lowest prevalence rates. It is unclear whether this contrast reflects actual differences in prevalence or whether current methods of assessment and diagnosis fail to accurately capture how anxiety is expressed in minoritized cultures and countries (Baxter et al., 2012).

### _Cultural Factors Impacting Prevalence_

_Note_. Bar graph illustrating prevalence rates of anxiety based on cultural factors. European/Anglo cultures have the highest prevalence of 10.40%, whereas Indo/Asian and African cultures have the lowest prevalence rate of 5.30%. The Central/Eastern European prevalence rate is 7.20%, Spanish/Latinx prevalence rate is 7.30%, and North African/Middle Eastern prevalence rate is 8.00%.

The difference in the¬† prevalence rates across demographic factors suggests that anxiety disorders have an uneven impact on different groups.¬†

Although clinicians‚Äô understanding of anxiety disorders has increased, it is far from complete; most of our current knowledge about anxiety disorders is primarily drawn from studies conducted on European/Anglo cultures and/or economically wealthier regions. In a recent survey of the cultures in which studies on anxiety have been conducted, more than half of the studies were conducted using participants from European/Anglo cultures (Baxter et al., 2012).¬†

This underrepresentation of data from members of racially and ethnically underrepresented cultures and countries is caused by a systematic lack of studies. In the United States, this problem of underrepresentation is further compounded because underserved communities (e.g., lower socioeconomic status, racially and ethnically minoritized cultures) are disproportionately impacted by stressors that greatly increase the likelihood of anxiety disorders (Zvolensky et al., 2017). Expanding the knowledge base to include underrepresented and minoritized communities will enhance our understanding of anxiety disorders.
