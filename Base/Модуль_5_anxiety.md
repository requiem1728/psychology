## Social Anxiety Disorder Example

![Start of scenario](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/qnH-IknHQXSgHJ9hRXRr1g_1c92637fd3fa4e83b75ff5a2cae1e8f1_StartScenario.png?expiry=1733788800000&hmac=mXqONlU-tI0U_B1D3yAka2EPqNLKeoEJfKsrpypvGgs)

Malik walks up to the podium trying to calm down.

“Deep breath,” Malik mutters to himself. 

It isn’t working. Malik feels his heart pounding in his chest and blood coursing through his temples. He starts to feel his face flush and he has the sensation of being hot and cold at the same time.

The class gives a muted applause. It’s Malik’s turn to present. 

He didn’t realize he was holding his breath, but then he heard himself gasp for air. 

 “Breathe man, breathe!_” he thinks._ 

It’s the same thing every time for Malik. He detests giving presentations. He’d much rather write a 20-page paper than speak in front of a classroom for 2 minutes. 

At the podium and fumbles trying to connect his laptop to the projector. 

_“Deep breath.”_ 

He grabs the side of the podium. His knuckles slowly start  turning white. He looks out at the classroom, above everybody’s head. He avoids making eye contact, even with his friends. His classmates stare blankly at him. _“They probably think I’m a joke._” 

Out of the corner of his eye, he notices his professor glance at him while making some notes on a writing pad.

“Oh, no. What have I done? I haven’t even started yet!” Malik pauses. 

“Deep breath.” 

Malik starts speaking and the muscles in his jaw lock up. Though he’s practiced the presentation a dozen times, he can’t remember any of what he was going to say. So, he ends up reading from his notes, sounding like a robot. 

“Damn. I’m better than this.” 

It’s going to be another painful presentation. 

![End of scenario](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/8PrKxeROT36dsGBXD4HQCQ_30babde95a244bc88723a72110491bf1_EndofScenario.png?expiry=1733788800000&hmac=qDX-c92tXTVayceLTCH3lwtQXcnIc0nQiw4089-7LCw)

## Diagnostic Criteria

In and of itself, Malik’s situation is far from unique. Perhaps you have experienced some of the same feelings. It is natural to feel a rush of anxiety before giving a presentation. Your sympathetic nervous system is working overtime, feeding your body adrenaline, raising your heart rate, and preparing you to take action. For most people, the anxiety that builds up before making their presentation tends to peak just before they speak and begins to dissipate once the presentation is under way. 

For people with social anxiety disorder, on the other hand, the impairment they experience tends to be much greater. People with **social anxiety disorder** experience intense, persistent anxiety in social or performance situations that continues, often becoming more intense, the longer the situation lasts. This anxiety causes significant distress and will often lead people to avoid situations likely to create the anxiety. Social anxiety disorder tends to be exacerbated in situations where people feel they are being evaluated by others. Some common triggers for social anxiety include performing or talking in public, talking with an authority figure, meeting new people, going to parties, making small talk, eating in front of others, and using a public restroom. Situations in which the negative evaluation is more salient tend to create higher levels of distress. Further, for the experience of social anxiety to be considered disordered, it must be present and causing distress for a continued period of time, at least several months (WHO, 2019).

For people with social anxiety disorder, the anxiety tends to be more intense, longer lasting, and more disruptive than it is for most people. During these periods of heightened anxiety, people with social anxiety disorder become extremely aware of their physiological responses, such as increased heart rate, perspiration, and blushing. This awareness can lead people to have thoughts that make the anxiety worse. For example, someone may be thinking: (1) “I’m feeling anxious,” (2) “Other people can see I’m feeling anxious,” (3) “Other people are judging me,” and (4) “People are thinking I’m awkward/I’m dumb/I should be fired.” As you can imagine, having these thoughts running through your mind can be distracting enough to make doing anything else difficult, whether the person is trying to sing an aria on stage, answer a question in a meeting, or simply ask a stranger for directions.

## Prevalence

The global lifetime prevalence of social anxiety disorder is approximately 4%. High-income countries like the United States, Japan, and Belgium have a higher prevalence  (~5.5%) than lower-middle and low income countries like Colombia and Iraq (~1.6%). The United States has the highest lifetime prevalence of social anxiety disorder (~12%) and countries in Africa, the Eastern Mediterranean, and Eastern Europe have the lowest rates (~1.5%). Women are diagnosed with social anxiety disorder almost two times more frequently than men (Asher et al., 2017; Jefferies & Ungar, 2020).

## Contributing Factors

### Behavioral Factors

Just like specific phobias, social anxiety disorder can arise from personal experiences with a traumatic social interaction, such as being repeatedly berated for mistakes by a parent; or by vicarious experiences, such as watching other students get teased for a perceived failing (Mineka & Zinbarg, 2006). 

Given the importance of social interaction in children’s development, negative social interactions such as bullying and teasing are likely to predispose them to develop a social anxiety disorder later in life. For example, 92% of adults with social anxiety disorder reported experiencing severe teasing and bullying as children. On the other hand, only about 35% to 50% of other anxiety disorders were attributed to childhood bullying or teasing. This suggests that, while negative social interactions play a role in generating anxiety in general, they may be especially impactful on the development of social anxiety disorder (McCabe et al., 2003). Interestingly, the type of bullying matters, too. Individuals who suffer from social anxiety report experiencing greater levels of teasing related to physical appearance, sociability, and their performance when being evaluated (McCabe et al., 2010). Individuals who suffered from bullying in front of others, where the teasing involved a negative judgment of other children, are particularly at risk for developing social anxiety disorder. Notice how the contexts of bullying match up well with the triggers of social anxiety disorder discussed previously.

### Cognitive Distortions

One effect of social anxiety disorder is the creation of **cognitive distortions**, which are inaccurate, typically negative, beliefs about your own abilities and what others think of you. People with social anxiety disorder often inaccurately assume that, whenever they are in the presence of other people, they are being evaluated. Because people with social anxiety are sensitive to being evaluated, this distortion intensifies any anxiety in a legitimately anxiety-provoking situation and creates anxiety where none need exist.

Some of the situations that generate social anxiety are actual, formal evaluations such as giving presentations or being interviewed for a job. Others are less formal, such as simply having a conversation with a group of people. In some cases, the perception that an audience is evaluating the person is the result of a cognitive distortion. That is, audience members are not really evaluating the person at all. In other cases, the audience itself is not real and the person is imagining what others would think of them if they were present (Heimberg et al., 2014). Whether these audience evaluations are real or imagined, individuals with social anxiety perceive and react to them as if they were real threats. People with social anxiety may experience the following cognitive distortions: distorted self-image, attentional bias, and interpretation bias.

#### Distorted Self-Image

Once a person suffering from social anxiety perceives the audience, they will form an internal representation of themselves. These representations of the self are often distorted. For example, when asked to give a speech, individuals with high social anxiety have more negative mental images of themselves than people without the disorder. These negative perceptions can be seen with respect to their social competence (“I am boring”), signs of their anxiety (“I am stuttering”), and their physical appearance (“I am unattractive”). The negative self-images generated from these distortions are associated with greater levels of anxiety and a greater degree of overestimating the negativity of others’ perceptions of them (Chiupka et al., 2012; Heimberg et al., 2014).

#### Attentional Bias

Individuals with social anxiety disorder often perceive other people as threats. This will lead them to avoid social situations or, if that isn’t possible, to distract themselves from the other people nearby. In a lab setting, Yiping Chen and colleagues (2002) demonstrated that, when shown pictures of faces and household items, people with social anxiety focused more on the household items than the faces, whereas people without social anxiety focused equally on each picture category. The participants with social anxiety showed an attentional bias against the faces. This avoidance strategy is likely helpful in managing anxiety, but it also means that people with social anxiety aren’t able to pick up cues from the environment. Such cues might suggest that people aren’t evaluating them or that people are evaluating them positively.

#### Interpretation Bias

Finally, individuals with elevated levels of social anxiety hold distorted perceptions that lead them to interpret neutral stimuli as threatening. For example, in one study, socially anxious participants who received positive, neutral, and negative feedback perceived the neutral feedback (e.g., “That’s an interesting shirt you’re wearing”) more negatively than did the other participants, who either had no anxiety or whose anxiety was not socially based (Amir et al., 2005).

Overall, cognitive distortions lead socially anxious people to perceive the social world as more threatening than it really is. As a result, they perceive themselves negatively and avoid social situations. Not surprisingly, people with social anxiety have difficulty forming relationships, including romantic relationships, as a result of these distortions (Sparrevohn & Rapee, 2009); and this further distorts their perceptions of how others evaluate them (Rapee & Heimberg, 1997).

## Cultural Issues

Cultural influences on acting in public vary widely. In some cultures, there is a strong expectation that individuals will engage in public behavior such as speaking, singing, or dancing. In such cultures, many people may feel some anxiety at these expectations. The anxiety experienced is only considered disordered when it is outside the norms for the society and causes some degree of distress. In other cultures, the norm is to not engage in public behavior such as speaking or expressing one’s opinions. In this type of cultural context, the avoidance of social behavior will not be considered symptomatic of social anxiety disorder unless the level of anxiety violates societal expectations.

The experience of social anxiety and the distress it causes is unique to a particular culture. For example, taijin kyofusho is a culture-specific variation of social anxiety disorder that is primarily seen in Japan. Its primary characteristic is that individuals with the disorder have an intense fear of offending others, as opposed to a fear of being evaluated negatively (Tseng et al., 2012). Individuals with taijin kyofusho fear exhibiting socially inappropriate behaviors, such as excessive eye contact or personal defects such as unpleasant body odor because others may find those things offensive and be put into a negative state as a result. This focus on interpersonal relationships and the effects of the self on other people distinguishes taijin kyofusho apart from the social anxiety typically seen in Western countries, which typically focuses on anxiety as a result of the threat of negative evaluations of the self.


# Diagnostic Criteria, Prevalence, Contributing Factors, and Cultural Issues for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder

## Diagnostic Criteria

Of all the disorders that involve anxiety, you may be most familiar with **obsessive-compulsive disorder** **(OCD)**, a disorder that involves recurrent thoughts (obsessions) or behaviors (compulsions). Though familiar with obsessive compulsive disorder through media and pop culture, many people misunderstand or minimize the severity of the disorder. 

People suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder experience obsessions and compulsions. **Obsessions** as recurrent, unwanted, and intrusive thoughts that lead to anxiety and distress (APA, 2013). Common obsessions include the fear of being contaminated by dirt or germs, the desire to have order and symmetry, superstitions, and thoughts that are violent or sexual. 

**Compulsions** are ritualized, repetitive behaviors, often undertaken in response to the anxiety caused by obsessions (APA, 2013). Common behaviors can include frequent handwashing or checking behavior, such as checking to make sure doors are locked, the stove is turned off, or loved ones are safe. Compulsions also include “mental acts,” such as counting, tapping, or repeating a phrase. 

As is true with other disorders that cause anxiety, it is not the thoughts or behaviors that are the main problem. Everyone washes their hands, more frequently now since the COVID-19 pandemic, and checking behaviors are not atypical. It is the frequency or amount of time spent engaging in thoughts and behaviors that make them obsessions and compulsions, respectively. For a person to be diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder, they must spend at least an hour a day engaged in obsessive thinking and/or compulsive behavior and these actions must cause distress, and impair the person’s functioning in some way (in relationships, at school or work; APA, 2013).

Consider the story of Shane Larkin, a professional basketball player who played for a time with the Boston Celtics. Sports writer Jackie MacMullan chronicled Larkin’s struggle with obsessive compulsive disorder (2018, August 22):

![Start of block quotation](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/pDxIIX9XRBqXBIdNGFjKqw_82193793b8544583992ec5f3055f58f1_OpenQuote.png?expiry=1733788800000&hmac=PddC8mMFPgXyd54dpCBi9tylKOPx6uuBfsN1P6o6NOc)

**SHANE LARKIN OPENS** his eyes, sits up and embarks on his own tortured version of "Groundhog Day." He grabs the remote, clicks on SportsCenter and hops out of bed to wait for his "number.'' He is 8 years old, and every morning presents a new set of unpredictable parameters that are purely arbitrary. As he starts to get dressed for school—a ritual that can last a few minutes or sometimes hours, depending on the number for the day—he notices an image of Ray Allen flickering on his television screen. Allen, it seems, hit eight 3-pointers in a game the night before. Suddenly, a sensory message makes a beeline for Shane's brain and informs him of the number for the day: eight.

"And then I know,'' Larkin tells ESPN, "that I have to wash my hands eight times.''

![End of block quotation](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/PdgjOh92QoGySDDK0VftvA_b3eaf695c4d04fbea618b04fe201fef1_CloseQuote.png?expiry=1733788800000&hmac=aShUHPH8Dbm2q5MeoV8sDoweoweXnVHHiywsEnCYG80)

For the rest of that day, any time Larkin touched anything that made him anxious, he would have to return to the washroom and wash his hands eight times. On days when his number for the day was smaller, he was grateful he would not have to spend quite so much time handwashing.

Common obsessions include worrying about harming yourself or others, being contaminated by dirt or germs, concerns about following superstitions, and fearing you have forgotten something important. Common compulsions that people undertake to combat such obsessions include washing hands, ordering and arranging things, praying excessively, hoarding newspapers and empty containers, and checking behavior, such as repeatedly checking to be sure the stove is turned off or the doors are locked

Patients with obsessive compulsive disorder vary in how much insight they have into the beliefs associated with their disorder (APA, 2013). Patients with good insight know the house will probably not burn down if the stove is not checked 30 times. At the other end of the continuum are patients with poor insight/delusional beliefs who are convinced the house will burn down if the stove is not checked. Insight can vary within an individual over the course of the illness. Patients with poor insight have worse long-term outcomes than patients with good insight.

Compulsive behavior provides short-term relief. Eventually, though, the obsessive thoughts will return, requiring additional compulsive behavior. Compulsive behavior is maladaptive. Repeated checking behavior may cause a person to miss work or school or not have enough time to study for exams or complete assignments, increasing the likelihood the person will be fired from work or fail at school. Excessively seeking reassurance from others damages relationships, reducing opportunities for social support that could help a person cope with their distress.

## Prevalence

The lifetime prevalence of OCD is about 1.5% (Kessler et al., 2005). Prevalence of OCD is lowest for those over the age of 60 (about 0.5 %) and highest for those in the 30-44 age group (about 2.5%), followed by the 18-29 age group (about 2%).

In childhood more boys than girls are diagnosed with OCD, but in adulthood, more women than men receive a diagnosis of OCD. There are similar rates of OCD, as well as course and prognosis, around the world, although there are a few cultural differences in the types of obsessions and compulsions (APA, 2013).

## Contributing Factors

### Biological Factors in Developing OCD

Biological contributors include genetic factors, atypical functioning in brain circuitry and brain structures involved in executive function and regulation of emotion, and activity of the neurotransmitters serotonin and dopamine in the brain.   

#### Genetics

Studies conducted as early as the 1930s have found consistent evidence that some forms of obsessive compulsive disorder run in families (Grabe et al, 2006; Hettema et al., 2001; Pauls, 2010; Pauls et al., 2014). For example, if one member of a twin pair has obsessive compulsive disorder, the other twin is at higher risk for developing the disorder. This is especially true for identical twins, who share 100% of their genes. If one identical twin has obsessive compulsive disorder, the probability that the other twin develops obsessive compulsive disorder can be as high as 80% (Hudziak et al., 2004; Inouye, 1965). For fraternal twins, who share 50% of their genes, if one twin has obsessive compulsive disorder there is a 25%–50% chance of the other twin developing the disorder (Hudziak et al., 2004; Inouye, 1965). When considering possible influences on the likelihood of developing symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder, Shelley Taylor (2011) found that genetics accounted for about 40% of the variability in developing symptoms. Unique environmental influences, such as a stressful life event experienced by only one twin, explained about 50% of the variability in the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder (Taylor, 2011).

#### **Brain Structure and Function**

A number of studies have provided evidence that brain circuitry involving neural pathways from regions of the frontal lobe to the striatum, called the frontostriatal circuit, along with an area of the brain called the nucleus accumbens are implicated in obsessive compulsive disorder (Saxena & Rauch, 2000; Milad & Rauch, 2012; Pauls et al., 2014). The frontostriatal circuit is involved in tasks of cognitive flexibility and behavioral adaptation, and the nucleus accumbens influences feelings of reward and satisfaction (Chamberlain et al., 2006; Salgado & Kaplitt, 2015). Typically individuals are able to control the common experience of intrusive thoughts, urges, and behaviors. Individuals with obsessive compulsive disorder, however, have difficulty pushing obsessive thoughts and feelings out of their minds and inhibiting compulsive behaviors. Researchers believe that overactivity in the neural pathways of the frontostriatal circuit impairs the kind of executive function needed to control intrusive thoughts and inhibit compulsive behavior (Milad & Rauch, 2012; Pauls et al., 2014, but see Abramovitch et al., 2013). The image Frontostriatal Circuitry and OCD shows a representation of these areas of the brain.

#### _Frontostriatal Circuitry and OCD_

![Illustration of frontal lobe.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/vZIyyZtkQVuQwtnL1oAlsg_f826584d426b444d91c1358de38ba9f1_ARDCAM04FG010-Frontostriatal-Circuitry.jpg?expiry=1733788800000&hmac=QiOqbQo31lLVxRjdRV-KtyHGTJEqPtTLZ3ZpIE91_No)

_Note_. The brain’s frontostriatal circuit includes the frontal lobe and the striatum. Overactivity in these brain areas, along with the nucleus accumbens and the amygdala, contribute to obsessive compulsive disorder.

Researchers have also found evidence supporting the role of two additional brain regions: the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), which is involved in error monitoring, and the amygdala, which plays a role in regulation of fear (Milad & Rauch, 2012; Rauch et al., 2003; Shin & Liberzon, 2010). Productive human behavior requires a person to have the ability to identify appropriate behavior in a situation, and easily adapt when an error is made ([Orr](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Orr%20C%5BAuthor%5D&cauthor=true&cauthor_uid=22723775) & [Hester](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Hester%20R%5BAuthor%5D&cauthor=true&cauthor_uid=22723775), 2012). Patients suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder show hyperactivation of the ACC, which may account for difficulties in adjusting and controlling their behaviors (Saxena & Rauch, 2000). Further, obsessive compulsive disorder patients show exaggerated amygdala activity, resulting in fear responses to stimuli that would not produce a fear response in people who do not have obsessive compulsive disorder (Milad & Rauch, 2012).

#### Neurotransmitters

Neurotransmitters are chemicals released by neurons that carry messages to other neurons. The neurotransmitter that has most consistently been implicated in obsessive compulsive disorder is serotonin (Bandelow et al., 2016). In the brain, serotonin is an excitatory neurotransmitter that affects mood; that is, when serotonin is released by neurons it makes it more likely that other neurons will fire. When more serotonin is present, mood is elevated. Its importance in obsessive compulsive disorder, though, has more to do with its role in the frontostriatal circuit. As explained previously, dysfunctions of the frontostriatal system trigger obsessive compulsive disorder symptoms. These problems can be thought of as difficulties in the ability of the frontal lobe to communicate with other parts of the brain, a process that is influenced by levels of serotonin (Murphy et al., 1990). Treating individuals with obsessive compulsive disorder with medications that increase serotonin levels appears to reduce overactivity in the frontostriatal circuit (Lissemore et al., 2018). The neurotransmitter dopamine, another important chemical messenger in the frontostriatal circuit,  also appears to play a role in the experience of obsessive compulsive disorder symptoms (Pauls et al., 2014).

### Environmental Factors Influencing OCD

#### Cognitive Contributors

Clinical psychologists Dianne Hezel and Richard McNally (2016) reviewed studies examining the dysfunctional beliefs that play a role in obsessive compulsive disorder. They identified three cognitive distortions that perpetuate the obsessions and compulsions experienced by patients: overestimation of threats and a sense of inflated responsibility, a need to control thoughts, and intolerance of uncertainty. 

- **Overestimation of Threats and Inflated Responsibility:** Clinical psychologist Paul Salkovskis (1985) and many others believe that at some point, everyone experiences the same kind of intrusive thoughts that patients with obsessive compulsive disorder experience. People with obsessive compulsive disorder, though, seem to misinterpret the importance of these thoughts, which then leads them to engage in compulsions to relieve the anxiety produced by the intrusive thoughts (Rachman, 1997). Salkovskis developed a cognitive behavioral model of obsessive compulsive disorder, in which he proposed that individuals with obsessive compulsive disorder catastrophically misinterpret the importance of normal, distressing thoughts (Hezel & McNally, 2016, p. 221).  For example, such individuals may misinterpret intrusive thoughts as indications of potential harm or danger and feel responsible for preventing the harm. A person without obsessive compulsive disorder may think food being served at a restaurant could easily be poisoned, but would likely dismiss the thought as silly. A patient with obsessive compulsive disorder, however, may believe the food is poisoned and believe they and the other diners in the restaurant are in danger. Thus, the obsessive compulsive disorder patient might speak with the manager about the restaurant’s safety record. Even a patient with good insight, who knows at some level their beliefs are irrational, may feel anxious and engage in compulsive behaviors in an effort to manage the anxiety caused by their intrusive thoughts (Hezel & McNally, 2016). 
    
- **Need to Control Thoughts:** Some patients with obsessive compulsive disorder hold  the inaccurate belief that their thoughts are powerful and need to be controlled. Specifically, they confuse thought and action (Berle & Starcevic, 2005). They may believe, for example, that thinking something bad is equivalent to doing something bad. That is, a thought about hurting someone is the same as actually hurting them. These patients may also believe that thinking about a negative event makes it more likely that the event will occur (Rachman & Shafran, 1999). The over-importance placed on thoughts, then, is the result of believing that simply thinking about an action is equivalent to engaging in that action and that thinking about an event makes that outcome more likely. When the thoughts are about negative or harmful outcomes, as they typically are in obsessive compulsive disorder, patients feel compelled to control their thoughts to prevent negative outcomes for themselves and others (Shafran & Rachman, 2004).
    
- **Intolerance of Uncertainty:** People suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder tend to have a low tolerance for uncertainty, finding it distressing (Holaway et al., 2006). The uncertainty may lead to specific compulsions aimed at reducing the anxiety caused by the uncertainty. For example, checking behavior is particularly relevant to feelings of uncertainty because it allows the patient to temporarily reduce the uncertainty they are experiencing (Tolin et al., 2003).
    

#### Behavioral Contributors

As mentioned previously, patients with obsessive compulsive disorder have intrusive thoughts that cause them distress and they engage in compulsive behaviors to reduce the distress caused by such thoughts. Though the compulsive behaviors bring only temporary relief from distress, the relief is rewarding. Each time a compulsion provides relief from distress and worry, however temporary, it is being reinforced, which makes it more likely to occur in the future (Taylor, 2005). In operant conditioning terms, compulsions benefit the individual through negative reinforcement. Remember that negative reinforcement involves taking an unpleasant stimulus away to provide relief. In this case, a person with obsessive compulsive disorder experiences distress produced by the obsession, engages in compulsive behavior that relieves the distress, and the relief provides a reward for engaging in the compulsion (Abramowitz et al., 2009).

Avoiding distressing situations altogether is a second way in which behavioral contributors maintain obsessive compulsive disorder symptoms. obsessive compulsive disorder patients who experience distress in certain situations may avoid those situations as a means of avoiding the distress they feel there. Individuals who fear dirt and germs may feel that public transportation is dirty and walk miles to get to work each day, or choose jobs that allow them to work from home. Avoiding the distress caused by using public transportation becomes rewarding, increasing the likelihood that they will continue to walk to work.

#### The Effects of Racial Discrimination 

Discrimination is defined as unfair treatment resulting from membership in a social category such as race, ethnicity, age, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, or religion. Many research studies have found that discrimination of any kind has a negative effect on the mental health of those who are discriminated against, often affecting generations (Berger & Sarnyai, 2015; Himle et al., 2008; Mouzon et al., 2017). Psychologist Monnica Williams and her colleagues (2012, 2016, 2017) examined how racial discrimination affects the expression of obsessive compulsive disorder in Black people.

The researchers conducted interviews with 3570 people as part of the National Survey of American Life: Coping with Stress in the 21st Century (Himle et al., 2008). Respondents were asked about the presence of obsessions and compulsions and also about their experiences with two types of everyday discrimination: everyday racial discrimination and everyday non-racial discrimination (i.e. discrimination due to age, weight, gender, or other characteristics).

Respondents were first asked how often they had experienced everyday discrimination, including being treated with disrespect, receiving poor restaurant service, being perceived as dishonest, being insulted, and being followed in stores. Respondents who indicated that they had experienced everyday discrimination were then asked if the discrimination was due to their race, gender, sexual orientation, income, age, height, or weight. From the answers to these questions, the researchers divided the discrimination into two categories: everyday racial discrimination and everyday non-racial discrimination.

African Americans who reported experiencing more racial discrimination were more likely to  engage in obsessive thinking (Sternthal et al., 2011). Those who experienced non-racial discrimination, however, were not. The same pattern was observed for compulsions: African Americans who experienced high levels of racial discrimination were more likely to perform compulsive behavior, including handwashing, checking behavior, and arranging behavior while those who experienced non-racial discrimination did not (Williams et al., 2017).

## Cultural Issues

The experience of obsessive-compulsive disorder in different cultures appears to be relatively similar (Horwath & Weissman, 2000; Nicolini et al., 2017). The presentation of symptoms is not identical world-wide, though. In some countries, a larger number of individuals experience only obsessions and in other countries, a larger number of individuals experience only compulsions (Horwath & Weissman, 2000). Still, few studies have examined differences in the presentation of obsessive-compulsive disorder world-wide, and studies that have examined differences have utilized relatively small samples, making it difficult to draw conclusions from the data.

# Types of Treatment for Disorders that Involve Anxiety

![Decorative image](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/0z14iOuNTDSY_LzbaY7U_g_f479431bf49241c8a01285d084fb5ef1_ARDCAM04FG012-Treatment-for-Disorders-that-Involve-Anxiety.png?expiry=1733788800000&hmac=CE1pokYobMGka-7a-yLk7D2hQ7xZKusPp74sFvWZlFQ)

## Drug Therapies

Drug treatments and cognitive behavioral therapy have traditionally shown a high degree of effectiveness at decreasing anxiety and treating anxiety disorders. Additionally, clinicians now use technology such as mobile apps and virtual reality therapy to increase the effectiveness of previously established therapeutic techniques. We will describe these various approaches separately, but it is quite common for these interventions to be used in combination to increase the effectiveness of the treatment.

Broadly, two categories of drug therapies have been shown to be effective at decreasing the severity of symptoms in anxiety disorders: **anxiolytic medications** and serotonin-based antidepressants. Anxiolytic medications, also called anti-anxiety medications, attempt to directly lower people’s anxiety, often by mildly sedating them. Examples of drugs in this class are benzodiazepines such as Valium and Xanax. These drugs are quite effective at immediately reducing even high levels of anxiety such as a person might experience in a panic attack. However, they are also habit forming and patients can develop a tolerance to the drug and experience withdrawal symptoms if they stop using the drug. For this reason, many researchers and clinicians (e.g., Baldwin et al., 2013) suggest that anxiolytic medications be prescribed for short-term use only. 

**Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors** **(SSRIs)** have also been shown to be effective at decreasing anxiety (Gomez et al., 2018). SSRIs are effective because serotonin plays an important role in the activation (and perhaps hyperactivation) of the brain’s fear circuit (Duval et al, 2015). Recall that the fear circuit refers to areas of the brain devoted to processing fear- and anxiety-relevant stimuli. SSRIs inhibit the reuptake of serotonin in the neurons’ synapses, thus increasing the level of serotonin in the brain. This works to reduce anxiety symptoms by stanching the hyperactivity in the fear circuit. Although SSRIs are, in general, less effective than anxiolytic drugs, they are non-habit forming and therefore more appropriate for long-term use (Gomez et al., 2018). 

Much research on obsessive compulsive disorder treatment has concluded that medication should be the first line of treatment. (Kellner, 2010). SSRIs appear to be effective in the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder. SSRIs increase levels of serotonin in the brain and work by elevating mood (Foa et al., 2005; Kellner, 2010). Serotonin also decreases activity in the frontostriatal circuit, which has been implicated in obsessive compulsive disorder (Kellner, 2010). Recall that overactivity in the frontostriatal circuit fosters intrusive thought and compulsive behavior (Milad & Rauch, 2012).

General anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder are most amenable to treatment with medication. Specific phobias are rarely treated with medication; instead they are best addressed with cognitive behavioral therapy.

## Cognitive Behavioral Therapy

Often referred to as the “gold standard” of psychotherapies (David et al., 2018), **cognitive behavioral therapy** **(CBT)** seeks to teach the patient thought-based and behavior-based coping skills that will help them decrease the anxiety that they are experiencing. For example, a person with generalized anxiety disorder could be taught the cognitive strategy of counterarguing their irrational fears. As another example, someone suffering from panic disorder could be taught a behavioral strategy consisting of controlled breathing and other relaxation techniques to reduce their physiological arousal during an attack.

To give patients practice using anxiety-reduction skills, the skill lessons are often combined with another cognitive behavioral technique—**exposure** **therapy**. Exposure therapy involves placing patients in situations where they are exposed to stimuli that evoke their anxiety. This exposure helps both by giving patients the opportunity to practice successfully coping with their feared stimuli and by helping them to realize that, despite their anxiety, the negative outcome they feared did not occur. 

Exposure treatments have been shown to be effective for an array of anxiety disorders including generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, specific phobias, and social anxiety disorder (American Psychological Association, n.d.). For example, as a part of a treatment designed to help a patient cope with panic disorder, the patient might be asked to do something that will mimic a symptom of a panic attack. In this case, the therapist would  direct the patient to hyperventilate, leading to an increase in their heart rate. This won’t pose any danger to the patient, but it does provide them with an opportunity to see that their heart can race without any negative consequences for their health. This type of exposure can also be used to show patients how deep breathing exercises will help them slow down their heart rate on their own. 

One type of exposure therapy that has been shown to be especially helpful when treating specific phobias is **systematic desensitization** (Wolpe, 1969). In systematic desensitization, patients are taught anxiety management techniques and then gradually exposed to mild versions of their feared object while practicing relaxation techniques. For example, a person with a spider phobia initially could be shown a picture of a small spider taken from very far away. After successfully reducing their anxiety to this mild stimulus, the patient would view a slightly more intense version of the feared object, such as a close-up picture of a large spider. While using the techniques they’ve learned to manage the anxiety, the patient will be exposed to more and more intense versions of their feared object. A live spider in a jar across the room could be followed by the same spider in a jar next to the patient and then the spider out of the jar on the couch next to the patient. This process of increasing the intensity of the exposure to the feared object while successfully controlling the fear is repeated until the patient can tolerate being directly exposed to the feared object itself.

CBT is commonly used for treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder (Derisley et al., 2008; O’Kearny et al., 2007). The cognitive aspect of CBT includes psycho-education and cognitive training with the client. Cognitive therapists believe psychological disorders are based, in part, on faulty thought processes (Beck, 1967). Thus, they endeavor to help clients recognize the thought patterns that are contributing to their symptoms (Foa et al., 2005; Libby et al., 2004). For example, a patient whose distress comes from an inflated sense of responsibility for the health of everyone in their city can be asked to reason through this cognitive distortion and recognize the events they actually can control (Barrett et al., 2008).

The behavioral aspect of CBT involves an effort to change behavior patterns, such as the  compulsions in obsessive compulsive disorder (Lewin et al., 2011). Compulsive behavior is often based on learned behavior that alleviates anxiety or distress. One behavioral technique used in the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder is exposure and response prevention—exposure to the feared stimulus and prevention of the ritual response, often while teaching relaxation techniques (Abramowitz et al., 2005; Lindsay et al., 1997). For example,  if a patient compulsively avoids stepping on cracks, and must perform some ritual like counting if they do, a therapist might take the patient outside, have them step on cracks  and prevent them from engaging in their normal response of counting. This helps the person to see that the anxiety will lessen on its own, especially with cognitive therapy to help patients understand their cognitive distortions. In the image “Negative Reinforcement of Compulsive Behavior” you will see a visual representation of how compulsive behavior can be negatively reinforcing.

### _Negative Reinforcement of Compulsive Behavior_

![Anxiety/distress leads to compulsive behavior, which reduces anxiety/distress, negatively reinforcing compulsive behaviors.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/0nwBItbiQvymvTEzCQAr4A_989c97c80f3a4f4696503cf7c6ad47f1_ARDCAM04FG011-Negative-Reinforcement-of-Compulsive-Behavior.jpg?expiry=1733788800000&hmac=YOTVzhoLd_T5pkTwn6E_HIf8gQgF-Pfr28ExPE5IL5A)

_Note_. Anxiety/distress leads to compulsive behavior, which reduces the anxiety/distress, and is negatively reinforced and more likely to be repeated in the future.

## Anxiety Treatment in the Digital Age

Technology can be directly integrated with CBT techniques because of their regimented, predictable, skill-based nature. For example, the use of virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) can allow people to have a direct exposure to their feared object or situation in a safe, controlled environment. Recent studies have demonstrated that patients suffering from specific phobias who were given VRET showed the same amount of real-world symptom improvement as in-person exposure therapy patients (Morina et al., 2015). 

The benefits of VRET are not restricted to specific phobias. Anna Felnhofer and her colleagues (2019) showed that exposing people with social anxiety to virtual social stress scenarios, such as ordering a drink from a waiter who subsequently brings the wrong drink, creates both the psychological and physiological anxiety reactions present in the real-world versions of these social stress scenarios. Because VRET is so effective at creating real-world anxieties, it is only a matter of time before therapists will have VRET setups that will allow them to expose patients to complex social scenarios in their office—something that was simply not possible previously. 

Modern technology can also be leveraged to help people retrain their focus of attention away from anxiety-producing stimuli. In one example, the **attention bias modification (ABM) task**, patients are shown anxiety-evoking stimuli alongside non-anxiety evoking stimuli and, over repeated trials, are trained to pay more attention to the non-anxiety evoking stimuli. This treatment reduces the power of the anxiety-evoking stimuli to capture their attention, thereby reducing the patient’s overall level of anxiety (Mogg et al., 2017). The theoretical foundation that underlies this treatment has been known for decades, but it’s only recently that researchers (Dennis & O’Toole, 2014) have created gamified mobile apps that have transformed this technique from one that was only available during a therapy session to one that could be used and practiced by people wherever and whenever they want. Who knew that video games can treat anxiety?!

## Learning objective: Discuss the diagnostic criteria, prevalence, contributing factors, and cultural influences for each of the disorders that involve anxiety.

1. Diagnostic criteria: Though the diagnostic criteria for each disorder vary, they all involve the experience of anxiety that is more extreme than would be expected by societal standards. In addition, the level of anxiety is sufficient to cause distress, potential danger to self or others, and significant impairment in daily life, including difficulty with work, school, family, and friendships.
    
2. Prevalence: Anxiety disorders are the most common type of psychological disorder world-wide. Approximately 7% of individuals globally will experience an anxiety disorder sometime in their lives. The global lifetime prevalence of social anxiety disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder is 4%, and 1.5%, respectively. Women are approximately twice as likely as men to report experiencing an anxiety disorder.
    
3. Contributing factors: Though there may be small differences between disorders, anxiety disorders generally result from a combination of biological and environmental factors. Evidence suggests that there  is a heritable component to some anxiety disorders such that some individuals are biologically predisposed to experience anxiety. In addition, functioning in the areas of the brain known as the fear circuit plays a major role in the experience of anxiety.
    
    1. A variety of environmental factors can influence the development of anxiety disorders. Extreme or long-lasting stress can increase the likelihood that an individual will experience anxiety. In addition, classical and operant conditioning can operate to create anxious responses. Finally, cognitive distortions can affect the development of anxiety disorders. The experience of racial discrimination can uniquely impact the experience of anxiety, especially obsessive-compulsive disorder.
        
4. Cultural influences: Researchers have found that the experience of anxiety and the development of anxiety disorders in Western and non-Western cultures. For some disorders there are significant differences in the experience of anxiety such that in non-Western cultures, individuals experience physical manifestations of anxiety more so than in Western cultures.
    
    1. Many cultures also experience anxiety in ways that are culture-specific and clinicians must take cultural factors into account when assessing an individual’s experience of anxiety.
        

## Learning objective: Describe the primary treatments for disorders that involve anxiety.  

1. Two categories of drug therapies have been shown to be effective at decreasing the severity of symptoms in anxiety disorders: **anxiolytic medications** and serotonin-based antidepressants. Anxiolytic medications, also called anti-anxiety medications, attempt to directly lower people’s anxiety, often by mildly sedating them.
    
    1. **Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)** are effective because serotonin plays an important role in the activation (and perhaps hyperactivation) of the brain’s fear circuit. SSRIs inhibit the reuptake of serotonin in the neurons’ synapses, thus increasing the level of serotonin in the brain. This works to reduce anxiety symptoms by stanching the hyperactivity in the fear circuit.
        
2. **Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)** seeks to teach the patient thought-based and behavior-based coping skills that will help them decrease the anxiety that they are experiencing.
    
    1. **Exposure therapy** involves placing patients in situations where they are exposed to stimuli that evoke their anxiety. This exposure helps both by giving patients the opportunity to practice successfully coping with their feared stimuli and by helping them to realize that, despite their anxiety, the negative outcome they feared did not occur.
        
    2. One type of exposure therapy that has been shown to be especially helpful when treating specific phobias is **systematic desensitization**. In systematic desensitization, patients are taught anxiety management techniques and then gradually exposed to mild versions of their feared object while practicing relaxation techniques.
        

## Learning objective: Explain how technologies such as mobile apps and virtual reality can aid in treating anxiety disorders.

1. Technology can be directly integrated with CBT techniques because of their regimented, predictable, skill-based nature.
    
2. Modern technology can also be leveraged to help people retrain their focus of attention away from anxiety-producing stimuli. In one example, the **attention bias modification (ABM) task**, patients are shown anxiety-evoking stimuli alongside non-anxiety evoking stimuli and, over repeated trials, are trained to pay more attention to the non-anxiety evoking stimuli.
