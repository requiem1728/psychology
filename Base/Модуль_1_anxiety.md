## Definition of Psychopathology

The term **psychopathology** has two overlapping definitions. First, it refers to the subfield of psychology concerned with the scientific study of mental disorders, including their theoretical underpinnings, causes, progression, symptoms, diagnoses, and treatment. Psychopathology is also a synonym for **psychological disorder**, which is an abnormal pattern of thoughts, feelings, or behaviors that leads to a negative outcome. Generalized anxiety disorder, depression, and alcohol use disorder are examples of psychopathologies. In the modules you are about to read, we will use ‚Äúpsychopathology‚Äù to refer to the field of study and we will refer to each psychological disorder by its name. One of the fundamental concepts in psychopathology is to differentiate between psychological conditions that are considered disorders and similar non-disordered conditions.¬†

As you read earlier, psychological disorders are abnormal patterns of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that result in a negative outcome. Different types of disorders result in a wide array of negative outcomes. These outcomes can be divided into three broad categories: distress, impairment, and danger. In order for an abnormality to be considered a psychological disorder, it must lead to at least one of these consequences. **Distress** refers to the negative emotions generated by abnormality. These can be negative emotions resulting from the disorder itself, as in anxiety and depressive disorders, or they can be negative emotions that arise secondary to the disorder. For example, a person with social anxiety disorder might feel sad about their lack of friends, and a person with obsessive-compulsive disorder may become angry at their inability to control their constant thoughts about germs and their resulting repetitive hand washing. Distress can also be experienced by people other than the person with the disorder, such as people affected by the negative behaviors of a person with narcissistic personality disorder.

Although many psychological disorders cause distress, there are some that do not. For example, patients with substance use disorder may enjoy the feeling the substance produces. Even if a disorder does not produce distress, it may cause **impairment,** which psychologists define as difficulty in any part of life, such as school, work, family, or community. For example, a person with depression may have trouble completing their schoolwork or performing at their job. In addition to distress and impairment, a psychological disorder can cause a person to be **a danger** to themselves or others.¬† Suicidality and self-harm behaviors, such as cutting, are extreme examples of the danger that psychological disorders can cause. Substance use disorders can increase the likelihood of people endangering themselves, by risking overdose or alcohol poisoning, or endangering others, through, for example, impaired driving.¬†

## Avoiding Stigma and Using Person-First Language

Historically, people with psychological disorders have experienced **stigma**. Stigma is a negative social attitude attached to a characteristic of an individual that may be regarded as a mental, physical, or social deficiency. For example, it was common to label people with their particular disorder. For example, psychiatric patients were commonly referred to as ‚Äúa schizophrenic‚Äù or ‚Äúa depressive.‚Äù Now it is considered more respectful to place the person first and refer to individuals as a ‚Äúperson with schizophrenia‚Äù or a ‚Äúperson with depression‚Äù (American Psychological Association, 2017).¬†

This type of language, called **person-first language**, considers the individual as a whole, not as someone who is just defined by their disorder. Saying someone is a ‚Äúperson with schizophrenia‚Äù makes it clear the person exists independent of the disorder, but calling someone a ‚Äúschizophrenic‚Äù defines them solely by their disorder. Ideally, using person-first language will help destigmatize people with psychological disorders. However, it must be noted that some people find person-first language to be awkward or condescending. As with race or gender, or any other characteristic of a person, it is important to find out how that person prefers to be described.

Persistent stigma has also arisen related to using derogatory terms to refer to people with disorders. Calling someone ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù or ‚Äúnuts‚Äù demeans both the person being called that and all other people with psychological disorders. Using derogatory terms implies that people with psychological disorders are not as valued as other people and can lead to prejudice and discrimination.

Finally, contemporary psychologists avoid using the word ‚Äúinsane‚Äù because it is a legal term, not a psychological term. Psychologists might testify in court about the psychological status of an individual, but the courts determine whether a person fits the legal criteria for insanity. A jury or judge may find a defendant not guilty because they were deemed ‚Äúinsane‚Äù when they committed the crime.

## Mental Health Diagnosis¬†

If you wake up sneezing one morning, you will probably try to figure out why you started sneezing. You may generate some ideas to explain why you might be sneezing, but if you were sneezing, coughing, and suffering from a sore throat, you might have a better idea: ‚ÄúAh, I have a cold.‚Äù¬†

If one morning you realize that you have felt sad for more than a month, you might try to figure out what is causing you to feel that way. You may generate some ideas for why you have been feeling sad, but if you realize that you often feel sad, are frequently tired, have lost weight, and are no longer interested in your normal activities, you might have a better idea: ‚ÄúI think I am suffering from depression.‚Äù

These scenarios provide examples of three important concepts in mental health diagnosis. A **symptom** is a specific characteristic, one that may be a sign of the presence of a particular condition. Sneezing is a symptom of the common cold, and prolonged feelings of sadness is a symptom of depression. A **syndrome** is a cluster of symptoms that often occur together. Sneezing, coughing, and a sore throat is a syndrome indicative of the common cold. Prolonged feelings of sadness, withdrawal from friends, and a loss of interest in previously enjoyable activities is a syndrome indicative of depression. When a syndrome matches the criteria for a disorder, clinicians make a **diagnosis**.¬†

As with physical disease like the flu, receiving a diagnosis can be beneficial for a client because it can guide the course of treatment. Diagnosing a client will give a clinician (a) an understanding of the underlying causes of the client‚Äôs condition and (b) the ability to choose an effective treatment plan. Therefore, receiving a diagnosis can be a helpful step for someone with a psychological disorder, because it means they have taken a step toward recovery.

## Ways to Classify and Understand Psychopathology

The two dominant diagnostic schemes in mental health are The American Psychiatric Association‚Äôs (2013; 2022) _**Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition**_ (_**DSM-5-TR**_) and the World Health Organization‚Äôs (2019) **International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 11th Revision** (_**ICD-11**_). Each contains a list of diagnostic criteria for every psychological disorder. If a patient exceeds the number of symptoms a disorder‚Äôs checklist requires, they can be diagnosed with that disorder.¬†

To ensure reliable diagnoses, clinicians and researchers need to have an established set of criteria that they use to diagnose a person with psychopathology. Fortunately, scientists and practitioners have created several classification schemes that provide standardized ways for evaluating whether an individual has a psychological disorder. This page focuses on the field‚Äôs two primary diagnostic manuals, the World Health Organization‚Äôs (2019) _**International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 11th Revision (ICD-11)**_ and The American Psychiatric Association‚Äôs (2013; 2022) _**Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5-TR)**_. Each contains a list of diagnostic criteria for every psychological disorder.

### _ICD-11_

_**ICD-11**_ (World Health Organization, 2019) is a diagnostic manual that has clinical descriptions and diagnostic criteria for every psychological disorder. It lists all of the existing psychological disorders along with the symptoms of and criteria for diagnosing each. Additionally, each disorder is given a diagnostic code that clinicians use to refer to diagnoses.

### _DSM-5-TR_

_**DSM-5-TR**_ (American Psychiatric Association, 2022) is the resource mental health clinicians and researchers in the United States and Canada use for diagnosing disorders in clinical settings and in research laboratories.¬† _DSM-5-TR_ is, in many ways, similar to _ICD-11_, which is not accidental, because _ICD-11_ and _DSM-5_ inform each other. In its most recent revision, _DSM-5-TR_ explicitly aimed to match the structure of _ICD-11_, and regrouped disorders to that end. _ICD-11_, in turn, is considering incorporating the updates that _DSM-5-TR_ made. Finally, _DSM-5-TR_ and _ICD-11_ now use the same diagnostic codes for diagnoses. In countries such as the U.S., in which health insurance is often used for healthcare costs, the codes are used when seeking reimbursement from insurance companies.

There are, however, several differences between the two manuals. First, _ICD-11_ is an all purpose medical diagnostic manual that lists every health condition that a person could be afflicted with‚Äîboth physical and psychological. So, whether you have heart disease, a fractured toe or bipolar disorder, it‚Äôs listed in _ICD-11_. Second, because _ICD-11_ is written by the World Health Organization (WHO), it is used throughout the world (with the exception of the United States and Canada where _DSM-5-TR_ is used). Finally, consistent with the WHO‚Äôs mission to increase the quality of health care in developing nations, it is available free of charge.

### Benefits and Drawbacks of _ICD-11_ and _DSM-5-TR_

The disorder characterization scheme present in _ICD-11_ and _DSM-5_ has several benefits. First, the schemes are both widely used and accepted, which standardizes the diagnostic process for everyone working in mental health. Second, it allows for a clear system of communication between clinicians. Third, it provides a specific, standardized diagnosis for each patient, which is useful for both researchers selecting participants and health insurers determining eligibility for coverage. The labels the manuals provide also give patients a name for what they are experiencing, which helps them find information and support groups, access services, and sometimes find comfort in knowing that others experience what they do.

On the other hand, _ICD-11_ and _DSM-5_ also have received criticism. Some would prefer to see the two manuals take a dimensional approach to diagnosis (in which the focus is ratings of patient characteristics on a scale, such as from mild to severe) as opposed to the categorical one that currently exists (e.g., Krueger & Bezdijan, 2009). Others have suggested that because disorders share a large number of possible symptoms, the rate of **comorbidity**‚Äîindividuals being diagnosed with multiple disorders simultaneously‚Äîis quite high. For example, Kate Allsopp and her colleagues (2019) noted that some symptoms can be associated with a wide array of disorders. For example, depressive disorders, bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, and numerous personality and stress-related disorders all can share psychotic symptoms (such as having hallucinations and delusions). Overall, the benefits of having a shared language to use when talking about and diagnosing disorders far outweighs the negatives of _ICD-11_ and _DSM-5-TR_.

## Cultural Issues in Diagnosis

Complicating diagnosis, psychological disorders can present themselves differently in different demographic and cultural groups. For example, when describing their depression, non-White patients are more likely to describe their symptoms in physically-oriented ways (e.g., fatigue) than are White patients (Long-Foley et al., 2002). If clinicians are unaware of these cultural differences, they may underdiagnose depression in non-White patients leading to the patients being denied appropriate treatments.¬†

When diagnosing attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), clinicians often rely on informant reports from parents and teachers. However, these informant reports are influenced and potentially biased by multiple factors including cultural differences in behavioral standards (Slobodin & Masalha, 2020). Compared to Black parents, White parents and White teachers are more likely to report observing disruptive behaviors in Black male children. However, it is unclear whether this difference in observed disruptive behavior is due to Black parents underestimating disruptive behaviors, or whether White parents and teachers overestimating these behaviors (Kang & Harvey, 2019). Clinicians must be aware of cultural discrepancies in behavioral standards to ensure proper diagnoses of ADHD.¬†

As a sign that the field is aware of these issues, starting with _DSM-IV_ (the precursor to _DSM-5_), the American Psychiatric Association acknowledged that cultural differences between the clinicians and clients may impact the quality of diagnostic decisions. Going a step further, _DSM-5_ includes a **cultural formulation interview** (**CFI**) that explicitly asks the patient (and, with permission, a person who knows the patient well) to explain their understanding of what they are experiencing and why they think the condition has arisen. Their answers can then be used to bridge cultural gaps in diagnosis by making explicit any cultural assumptions of the patient that the clinician might be unaware of. For example, Latino patients are more likely to attribute mental health problems to physical diseases and family issues than are White patients (Jimenez et al., 2012). Knowing that a Latino client talking about their lower back pain is not digressing, but instead explaining something they view as relevant to their psychological condition may enable a clinician to better understand the client‚Äôs perspective, decreasing the risk of missing important information.
