# Diverse Manifestations of Anxiety Disorders

![Decorative image](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/uDcAjhhySoulkGt03PqQSQ_d99356a64b27465381f14cd06075aef1_ARDCAM01FG009-Diverse-Manifestations-of-Anxiety.png?expiry=1733702400000&hmac=-p7JsQrOKH8_bvNjc1HMmdaSE1b8FoKMsaB-mJjMMCs)

Everyone feels anxiety. Sometimes that anxiety feels pleasant, as when a friend is walking down the aisle to be married. At other times it can feel incredibly unpleasant, as when a police car turns on its lights behind our car. In each case, we can point to physiological signals that we‚Äôre feeling anxious: Our heart rate increases, our pupils dilate, and we start to sweat. If the anxiety becomes too much to bear, we can use positive strategies to try to cope‚Äîsuch as deep breathing or mindfulness‚Äîor we can use less helpful strategies such as running away.

For most people, anxiety is helpful most of the time. It can get a person‚Äôs body ready for an important game or stage performance. It can warn a person when danger is approaching. Or it can help ensure that a person is focusing on an important task. However, for people with anxiety disorders, the anxiety takes on a more negative quality. It can be inappropriately intense, out of proportion to the threat that‚Äôs creating it, or inappropriately frequent, occurring without a good reason. It is often difficult or impossible to control with standard coping strategies, and it causes great distress or difficulty functioning in life. A person presenting with all of these symptoms is very likely to meet the criteria for an anxiety disorder.¬†

How do people know when they are experiencing anxiety? To some, this might seem like an odd question, akin to asking how people know when they are awake. However, the symptoms of anxiety can be misinterpreted or attributed to something other than anxiety. In some cases, people have strategies to deal with the anxiety that have become so automatic, they engage them without experiencing the anxiety itself. Someone who describes themselves as an overthinker or a control freak‚Äîor who vegges out in front of a TV show for hour after hour‚Äîmay very well be overthinking, seeking control, or distracting themselves from the world as a way of coping with their anxiety.

# The Components of the Autonomic Nervous System

The ANS has two components: the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS). These two systems complement each other to help the body deal with short-term stress and long-term maintenance, respectively. The SNS activates the body to deal with threats the person faces in the short term, and the PNS returns the body‚Äôs processes to normal for long-term maintenance. Consider, for example, the process of digestion. When you are feeling anxious about going up a skyscraper, your body does not need to direct energy to help digest a meal you ate recently. Instead, the SNS shuts down the process of digestion, to devote more energy to dealing with the stress of riding the elevator up the skyscraper. After you‚Äôre done viewing the sights and are stepping back on solid ground, you feel your body relax a little. You feel safer again, and your body can return to its focus on long-term maintenance, including digesting food. Activation of the SNS is a normal physical response to a stressor. Like other manifestations of anxiety, the SNS response can be adaptive. It‚Äôs only when anxiety starts to dominate your everyday life that it becomes a disorder.

## Learning objective: List the four components of anxiety.

1. Anxiety can produce both psychological and physiological consequences..
    
    - Cognitive consequences of anxiety include constant worrying, difficulty concentrating and problem-solving, and overthinking.
        
    - Stressful situations elicit emotions such as anxiety and fear. Anxiety and fear may manifest as feeling tense and uneasy, apprehensive and scared, or distressed and terrified, depending on how dangerous the situation is. These emotional responses might also be characterized as a feeling of dread.
        
    - Anxiety can also have behavioral manifestations. These include restlessness, sleep disturbances, and avoidance of anxiety-producing situations.
        
2. Anxiety and fear produce the same physiological response, known as the fight-or-flight response. The **fight-or-flight** **response** is a pattern of physiological changes elicited by activity of the [sympathetic nervous system](https://dictionary.apa.org/sympathetic-nervous-system) in response to threatening or otherwise stressful situations that leads to mobilization of energy for physical activity.
    
3. Stressful situations trigger a range of behaviors, most of which can be categorized either as efforts to deal with the stressor (that is, fight) or attempts to escape the stressor (that is, flight).
    

## Learning objective: Describe the components of the autonomic nervous system.

1. The **autonomic nervous system** (ANS) controls involuntary movements and regulates body organs.
    
2. The ANS also has two components, the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system.
    
    - The **sympathetic nervous system** **(SNS)** functions like an alarm system, triggering the fight-or-flight response.¬†
        
    - Once the stress has passed, the **parasympathetic nervous system** **(PNS)** takes over, calming and reversing the bodily changes triggered by the SNS when the body was on high alert. The PNS evokes a rest-and-digest response that focuses the body on long-term maintenance.
