## Diagnostic Criteria

A person with **generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)** experiences general apprehensiveness (also called free-floating anxiety) or excessive worry that negative events will occur in various areas of life such as work, school, health, family and relationships (APA, 2022; Crocq, 2017; WHO, 2019). These symptoms need to occur more days than not and have been present for at least three to four months, though the DSM indicates the symptoms need to be present for at least six months. The psychological symptoms (such as difficulty concentrating) are accompanied by¬† emotional symptoms (such as irritability), physiological symptoms (such as overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system resulting in heart palpitations, sweating, dry mouth, gastrointestinal symptoms), and behavioral symptoms (such as muscle tension, restlessness, trouble sleeping; APA, 2022; WHO, 2019). For example, a person with GAD may feel constantly anxious and worried, and may not be able to¬† remember a time when they felt free from anxiety. This anxiety is generalized; this person would not be¬† worried about a single upcoming event or threat, but instead would feel¬† anxious about whatever they are currently focused on.¬†

As you have read, some anxiety is typical, and can even be helpful. However, for people with GAD, their worries are very often out of line with reality: one study showed that 94% of the worries that people with GAD had did not come true (LaFreniere & Newman, 2020). This sort of uncontrollable worrying about events that most likely will not happen is typical of people experiencing GAD.

A complete picture of GAD includes its high likelihood of diagnosis along with other psychological disorders (its comorbidity) that occur at the same time or at other points in the lifespan (Noyes, 2001). The most common comorbid diagnoses are other anxiety disorders, especially panic disorder, and major depressive disorder. Unfortunately, because these diagnoses can reinforce each other, they often make treatments less effective and complicate recovery. For example, in a person with GAD and major depressive disorder, feelings of depression can lead to outcomes that result in anxiety, and suffering from frequent and continual anxiety can be depressing.

## Prevalence

The global lifetime prevalence (the proportion of a population that will have a disorder at some point in their life) of GAD appears to be 4%-5% (Kessler et al., 2012; Zuberi, 2021), though in some countries it has been found to be as low as 1.5% (Chang et al., 2019; Mohammadi et al., 2020). GAD is twice as common in women as in men (Crocq, 2017). Prevalence is relatively rare among adolescents and young adults but increases with age and is highest for those over 40 years.

## Contributing Factors

### Biological Factors in Developing GAD

Much research has examined biological differences between people who have GAD and those who do not. However, findings in this area are often inconsistent (Maron & Nutt, 2017). A few studies have found that GAD is associated with a larger volume of the amygdala‚Äîan area of the brain associated with the generation and experience of fear, along with differences in the locus coeruleus, an area that can intensify fear effects¬† (Etkin et al., 2009; Makovac et al., 2016). Other studies have used functional neuroimaging techniques like fMRI to show that patients with GAD display greater neural activity in areas such as the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the prefrontal cortex (PFC), an area involved in the regulation of emotion; along with nearly a dozen others (Blair et al., 2008; Lai, 2019; Paulesu et al., 2010).

Recently, psychologists have added a second approach to understanding how the brain processes anxiety. ¬†Instead of focusing on single brain areas, this research focuses on brain circuits, which are networks of interconnected areas involved in perceiving, processing, and responding to anxiety-relevant information (see Duval et al., 2015). Collectively, the areas described above are referred to as the **fear circuit** because they are devoted to processing fear- and anxiety-relevant stimuli. Because of the important roles that the neurotransmitters noradrenaline (Charney et al., 1987) and serotonin (Maron & Shlik, 2006) play in the fear circuit, many psychopharmacological treatments for anxiety in general and GAD in particular attempt to regulate those systems. The converging evidence emphasizes the important role of these brain structures in understanding GAD.

#### _The Fear Circuit_

![Four parts of the fear circuited highlighted on an image of the brain.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/vzGJeh26Q3aKQESGCYA5pw_423fe711a20f47b9804dd3fe806ea1f1_ARDCAM04FG002-Fear-Circuit.jpg?expiry=1733702400000&hmac=OkBMEeOhnGPgujMfi3xuvB1fagczb84b2PfZDzUO9cA)

_Note_. This image depicts the location of important parts of the fear circuit including the amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex, prefrontal cortex, and locus coeruleus.

Researchers have also identified several other biological factors that can make people more likely to develop GAD. GAD has a moderate level of heritability. Heritability is a measure of how much genetic influences affect a characteristic, such as the development of GAD. If the heritability of a characteristic is 0, it means that genetics contributes nothing to the development of the trait. A heritability of 1 indicates that genetics completely explains the development of the trait. The heritability of GAD is .32 indicating the likelihood of developing GAD is explained in part by genetic influences. In addition, numerous studies have suggested that mutations in genes that impact the functioning of the brain‚Äôs neurotransmitter can increase the likelihood of a person displaying the symptoms of GAD (Gottschalk & Domschke, 2017). Additionally, emerging research suggests that epigenetics‚Äîin which the environment exerts an influence on the way that genes are expressed‚Äîcan provide a biological explanation for how environmental factors such as childhood trauma can lead to GAD in adulthood (Gottschalk & Domschke, 2017; Peedicayil, 2020).

Finally, recent research results provide evidence that the amounts and types of bacteria in the digestive tract of people with and without GAD differ (Jiang et al., 2018). Although focusing on gut bacteria may seem odd when discussing psychological disorders, there is ample evidence to suggest that the quality of these bacteria can impact mental health via gut‚Äìbrain interactions (Chen, 2017). Giving further credence to this idea, Beibei Yang and colleagues (2019) reviewed a series of studies and concluded that treatments that improve the balance of digestive bacteria can significantly reduce anxiety levels in some participants (Yang et al., 2019).

### Environmental Factors Influencing GAD

In addition to biological factors, sociocultural factors also can affect GAD development. For example, stress is a factor that increases the likelihood of many psychological disorders, GAD among them. Michael Zvolensky and his colleagues (2017) have suggested that because immigrants, people of color, LGBTQ individuals, and people with low socioeconomic status (SES) experience high degrees of stress (from, for example, discrimination and a lack of resources), they are at a greater risk for developing anxiety disorders.

Psychological factors also play a role in the development of GAD. Experiencing adversity in childhood and having overprotective parents have been associated with GAD. Individuals with GAD are also likely to pay more attention to worrisome information than individuals without GAD.

## Cultural Issues

Researchers have found that people from numerous non-Western cultures experience GAD differently than do people from the West. Specifically, many non-Westerners experience the physiological symptoms of GAD more strongly than the psychological ones‚Äîthe reverse of what is typically found in Americans and Western Europeans. For example, Americans typically describe their GAD using language describing psychological symptoms such as¬† feeling scared or nervous. In contrast, Nepalis emphasize physiological symptoms such as dizziness and indigestion (Hoge et al., 2006). A similar focus on physical symptoms has been found in diverse cultures such as those of Hong Kong, Mexico, and the United Arab Emirates (Lewis-Fern√°ndez et al., 2010).¬†

One symptom of GAD is worry about the occurrence of negative events in some aspect of daily life. Which aspects of daily life are the subject of excessive worry is likely to be influenced by cultural factors. Cultures that place a high degree of value on family relationships may lead to excessive worry about the death of a loved one. Cultures that place an emphasis on individual achievement may lead one to worry about their level of accomplishment or success. Clinicians‚Äô judgments of a person‚Äôs symptoms must be informed by knowledge of cultural factors that provide the necessary context in which to understand a person's symptoms.


# Diagnostic Criteria, Prevalence, Contributing Factors, and Cultural Issues for Panic Disorder

![Decorative image](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/uiHyzDHsQuKXEYwS0j0p-A_a7f12462afad4cbea63444c30cf8b1f1_ARDCAM04FG003-Panic-Disorder.jpg?expiry=1733788800000&hmac=s1rSQ-PNzESV3rPdkgl_RshwdeIMNXDgpIEia3dEZVk)

## Panic Disorder Example

Carrie, a woman in her early 20s, was surprised one day when she felt her heart speeding out of control. The chest pains that accompanied her racing heart convinced her that she was having a heart attack. Terrified that she was going to die, she rushed to the emergency room, where doctors closely monitored her cardiac activity. Other than the fact that her heart was beating at an unusually fast rate, as if she had been exercising vigorously, Carrie‚Äôs tests showed that her heart was completely normal. She wasn‚Äôt having a heart attack or any other cardiac issue. After staying in the emergency room for a few hours to make sure the episode wouldn‚Äôt recur, Carrie was sent home.

Despite the ER staff‚Äôs reassurances, Carrie remained convinced that something was seriously wrong with her heart. When she followed up with her doctor and expressed her concern that the ER doctors missed something, she was referred to a heart specialist.¬† The cardiologist prescribed a monitoring device to¬† record Carrie‚Äôs heart‚Äôs activity. That test came back completely normal, as well. The cardiologist gave Carrie the good news that her heart was fine and suggested she follow up with a mental health care professional and get evaluated for panic attacks.

Carrie‚Äôs story is quite common; many people experiencing panic attacks misperceive the episode as a heart attack and arrive in an emergency room believing they are on the brink of death. The physical symptoms of a panic attack‚Äîa fast heart rate, shortness of breath, dizziness‚Äîare understandably very frightening. In turn, the intense fear generated by the panic attack terrifies the person into believing that whatever is happening will lead to disastrous consequences‚Äîlikely death.

Eventually Carrie followed up with a psychologist and was diagnosed with panic disorder. Carrie did indeed go on to have many panic attacks and, despite understanding that she had panic disorder, she was unable to shake the idea that there was something wrong with her heart. The fear resulting from the attacks led to hypersensitivity about any slight variations in her bodily sensations, and she interpreted them as evidence that she was about to die. Carrie lived in fear of having a panic attack.

Ultimately, Carrie was able to manage her panic disorder with a combination of psychotherapy and medication. Her panic attacks are much less frequent now, and she is able to talk herself out of believing that variations in her normal body rhythms are indicators that something is very wrong with her heart.

## Diagnostic Criteria

**Panic disorder** is an anxiety disorder in which people experience **panic attacks**‚Äîterrifying episodes consisting of an extreme feeling of fear accompanied by a very high level of physiological arousal (e.g., a pounding heart, sweating, and light-headedness). As the name suggests, when panic attacks occur, people experience an overwhelming sense of fear; many panic attack sufferers believe they are dying. The fear created by panic attacks is so great that people who experience them often describe it as the most frightened they have ever been. As a result, sufferers live in fear of having another attack. Adding to the fear is the unpredictability of the attacks. Panic attacks can occur at any moment, without warning and often without any obvious cause. These terrifying episodes can spring up when you are on a date, when you are taking a final exam or, if you are an all-star basketball athlete playing in the third quarter of an important game.

Suffering from panic attacks is a key symptom of panic disorder, however in order to be diagnosed with panic disorder people must also experience negative consequences from having the attacks. Specifically, they need to either experience persistent anxiety about the possibility of having another panic attack. In some cases, if there is an awareness of what might cause a panic attack, some people might change their behavior to avoid these situations.¬†

When taken to an extreme, these avoidance behaviors may meet the criteria for another psychological disorder, **agoraphobia**‚Äîa condition in which people actively avoid situations, such as¬† being in a crowd or being outside the home alone, due to the fear of having a panic attack. In severe cases, agoraphobia can leave its sufferers homebound, unwilling to leave for fear of inducing a panic attack. Panic disorder and agoraphobia can each exist independently, but they are frequently comorbid.

Because panic attacks usually occur without warning and without obvious causes, people experiencing their first attack often don‚Äôt realize what is happening. In fact, it‚Äôs very common (and quite reasonable) for people to interpret the extreme physiological activation (heart pounding, shortness of breath, chest pains) as signs of a heart attack. Typically, it‚Äôs only after a visit to the emergency room confirms that their cardiovascular system is healthy that physicians and patients start to consider the possibility that the reason for their physiological symptoms was a panic attack.

## Prevalence

The global lifetime prevalence of panic disorder is approximately 1.7% (de Jonge et al., 2016). Prevalence is higher in the United States (4.7%) than in many other regions, including South America (2.2%), East Asia and Australia (2.0%), Western Europe (1.9%), the eastern mediterranean region (1.0%), Eastern Europe (0.9%), and Africa (0.2%). High income countries like the United States, Japan, and Belgium have a higher prevalence¬† (2.2%) than countries with lower GDP such as Colombia, Iraq, and China (~0.8%). In the United States, white Americans have the highest prevalence rate with Asian, Latina/o, and African Americans all showing lower rates (APA, 2013).

Though estimates vary study to study, most estimate that women are 1.5 to 2.5 times¬† more likely to receive a diagnosis of panic disorder as are men (Eaton et al., 1994; Kessler et al., 2005). There are multiple potential explanations for this difference including the facts that women are more sensitive to oxygen deprivation than men and tend to have more separation anxiety as well (Leskin & Sheikh, 2004). Although there is not a firm scientific consensus on the reason for this gender difference, the magnitude of the difference is largely consistent across cultures, suggesting that it is not a function of gender norms specific to one or a small number of cultures (Gater et al., 1998).

## Contributing Factors of Panic Disorder

### Biological Factors

The evidence for the role of genetics in panic disorder is relatively straightforward. Like other anxiety disorders, panic disorder tends to run in families. The likelihood of someone suffering from panic disorder is 3 to 5 times higher in families where at least one first-degree relative (i.e., a parent, child, or sibling) has the disorder (Weissman, 1993). Consistent with this idea, several studies have shown that panic disorder has higher concordance rates (if one twin has a characteristic, the likelihood that the other twin also has the characteristic) in identical twins than fraternal twins (e.g., Perna et al., 1997). Identical twins share 100% of their genes, while fraternal twins share only about 50%. The higher concordance rates of panic disorder for identical twins indicates that the reason panic disorder runs in families must have a genetic component‚Äîas opposed to arising solely from non-biological sources like a family living in a stressful environment or children learning to panic by watching their parents.

As is true with GAD, researchers have identified numerous structures in¬† the brain involved¬† in the generation of panic attacks. These structures include the amygdala, an area associated with the generation and experience of fear; the locus coeruleus, an area that can intensify fear effects; and the prefrontal cortex, an area involved in the regulation of emotion; along with nearly a dozen others (Butler et al., 1990; Gorman et al., 2000; Lai, 2019). Collectively, these areas are referred to as the **fear circuit**. Because of the important roles that the neurotransmitters noradrenaline (Charney et al., 1987) and serotonin (Maron & Shlik, 2006) play in the fear circuit, many psychopharmacological treatments for anxiety in general and panic disorder in particular attempt to regulate those systems. Recall the image of the fear circuit that appeared earlier.

### Environmental Factors

Panic Disorder arises also from cognitive factors‚Äîhow people think about themselves and the world. How we experience our bodily reactions to minor stressors can also affect our likelihood of having a panic attack. Individual differences in **anxiety sensitivity**‚Äîthe awareness of, and concern about, sensations of anxiety arising from our bodies‚Äîplay an important role in the creation of panic. As the name implies, people who are higher on anxiety sensitivity are more likely to interpret normal physiological variations, such as¬† slight heart rate increases due to walking up a flight of stairs, as indicating potentially catastrophic health problems. In turn, this oversensitivity can set off a chain reaction of worry‚Äîa person gets concerned they are having a heart attack, that anxiety increases their heart rate further fueling their anxiety about their heart‚Äîultimately leading to a panic attack (Asmundson & Norton, 1993; Cox, 1996).¬†

## Cultural Issues

As is true of GAD, the presentation of symptoms of panic disorder can be influenced by cultural issues, often through the personal explanations or attributions for the cause of the symptoms a person is experiencing (APA. 2022; ICD, 2019). For example, Cambodian individuals who have been traumatized by experiences as a refugee may attribute panic symptoms to dysregulation of khy√¢l, a wind-like substance that produces symptoms such as dizziness, tinnitus, and neck soreness (Hinton et al., 2010).

Other cultures, too, have explanations for panic symptoms specific to aspects of regional or national culture. Panic in Latin America may manifest itself in an _ataque de nervios_ (an intense emotional experience, typically accompanied by yelling, crying, and trembling), but in Nigeria the same anxiety may present as a case of _odei ori,_ in which the person reports feeling like something is crawling around inside their brain (Makanjuola, 1987). For a diagnosis of panic disorder, the response of panic must be excessive and unexpected. Decisions regarding the nature of an individual‚Äôs panic must be informed by knowledge of cultural influences that provide context in which to understand the symptoms.

# Diagnostic Criteria and Prevalence for Specific Phobias

## Specific Phobia Example

![Start of scenario](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/qnH-IknHQXSgHJ9hRXRr1g_1c92637fd3fa4e83b75ff5a2cae1e8f1_StartScenario.png?expiry=1733788800000&hmac=mXqONlU-tI0U_B1D3yAka2EPqNLKeoEJfKsrpypvGgs)

‚ÄúLights out, campers!‚Äù

‚ÄúHey! Cabin 2, stop playing with your flashlights and go to bed!‚Äù

It wasn‚Äôt long before the muffled giggles from inside the cabins started to subside. The campers had had a long and eventful day.¬†

‚ÄúI hope nobody sneaks out tonight,‚Äù the camp counselor thought to himself as he settled into his hammock outside the cabins.¬†

Suddenly, there was a scream from Cabin 2. A young camper, Miguel, rushed out screaming, tears streaming down his face.¬†

‚ÄúThere is a spider, I saw a spider. I hate spiders!‚Äù Miguel cried out between gasps.¬†

The counselor was going to send Miguel back to his cabin, but then took a quick look at the child‚Äôs face and realized that Miguel wasn‚Äôt just playing up his fear in an attempt to delay lights out. Miguel was terrified!

Seeking to calm the hyperventilating camper, the counselor told him that spiders are good to have around because they eat bugs, and that spiders are more afraid of him than he is of them. Despite the counselor‚Äôs good intentions, every mention of spiders only made Miguel more scared. Ultimately, the counselor took Miguel to the nurse‚Äôs office and, after convincing him that there were no spiders anywhere near the cabin, Miguel finally fell asleep.

The next morning, Miguel told the nurse about his fear of spiders:

‚ÄúOne time, I was playing with some empty flower pots in our shed. There must have been a spider‚Äôs nest in there and all of a sudden, dozens of spiders were crawling all over me. They started biting me and‚Ä¶" His voice trailed off and he closed his eyes to try to calm himself down.

![End of scenario](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/8PrKxeROT36dsGBXD4HQCQ_30babde95a244bc88723a72110491bf1_EndofScenario.png?expiry=1733788800000&hmac=qDX-c92tXTVayceLTCH3lwtQXcnIc0nQiw4089-7LCw)

## Diagnostic Criteria

Feeling fear from time to time is normal. Fear can be adaptive and even motivating in the right circumstances. However, individuals who have a **specific phobia** of an object, situation, or environment experience a persistent and irrational fear that is distressing and profoundly interferes with their ability to function. Common phobic stimuli include snakes, heights, and blood. Although specific phobias do focus on a single feared stimulus, most individuals who have a specific phobia are likely to suffer from at least one or more additional phobias (APA, 2013; LeBeau et al., 2010).¬†

As you saw in Miguel‚Äôs case, individuals who suffer from specific phobias find ways to avoid the phobic stimuli whenever possible. If this is not possible, they will attempt to endure the phobic stimuli while exhibiting marked distress. What is particularly striking about specific phobias is that the individual is often aware that their behavior and response to the phobic stimuli are irrational (Eaton et al., 2018). For example, if Miguel sees a spider inside a locked glass box, he would still experience a high degree of fear and try to escape the situation, despite knowing that he is perfectly safe.¬†

Miguel was able to identify the experience that created his specific phobia. This is typical of most people with specific phobias, but in some cases people cannot point to a specific event that led to the phobia (Mineka & √ñhman, 2002).

People have phobias of a wide range of objects and situations. Some of the most common are included in the following table, ‚ÄúSpecific Phobia Examples.‚Äù

### Specific Phobia Categories

|Category|Common Fears|
|---|---|
|Blood, injection, or injury|Seeing blood, receiving an injection, or seeing a person suffer an injury|
|Animals|Spiders and other insects, snakes, dogs|
|Specific natural environments|Heights, open water, severe weather, such as thunder and lightning|
|Specific situations|Enclosed spaces, driving on the highway, being in the dark, flying in a plane|

_Note_. This table shows examples of each of DSM-5‚Äôs categories for specific phobias.

Notice that there are several common fears not listed in the above table: the fear of public speaking and the fear of embarrassing yourself in public. These are examples of social phobias and are covered in our next section, on social anxiety disorder.

## Prevalence

At one time or another, you might have casually said that you have a phobia of heights, spiders, dogs, or some other stimulus. Although many of us use the term ‚Äúphobia‚Äù to describe our fears in casual conversation, only about 7% of the global population is diagnosed with a phobia in their lifetime (Eaton et al., 2018). Whereas rates in the United States and European countries range from 6%-9%, rates in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are typically 2‚Äì4% (APA, 2013). In general, prevalence rates are higher in middle and higher income countries and lower in lower income countries (Wardenaar et al., 2017).

Both worldwide and in the United States, women are approximately twice as likely to be diagnosed with a specific phobia as men (APA, 2022; Wardenaar et al., 2017). In the United States, Asian and Latino/a Americans have lower rates of specific¬† phobias than White, Black, and Native Americans (APA, 2022).

# Contributing Factors for Specific Phobias

## Biological Preparedness¬†

As you have read, there are many different types of specific phobias, but the most commonly held ones tend to focus on objects or situations that could cause people harm or death. The frequency of phobias of spiders, snakes, and heights bears this out. However, absent from lists of common phobias is an object that also carries a degree of danger: firearms. This raises the question: Why is there a disconnect between different types of dangerous items?

Evolutionary theory suggests that millenia of exposure to death or disability from contact with snakes, spiders, and heights has biased humans toward fearing those stimuli (McNally, 2016; Seligman, 1971). Evolutionary psychologists assert that ancestral humans who developed fears of lethal animals and situations were more likely to survive and pass their genes onto future generations. This passing on of their genes led to the inherited trait of a bias toward fearing life threatening animals and situations. Martin Seligman coined the term **biological preparedness** to represent this simple idea‚Äîbecause of our species‚Äô evolutionary history, modern humans are more likely to learn to fear and develop phobias about objects and situations that were threats to our ancestors‚Äô lives. This provides a simple explanation for why people easily develop phobias about snakes (which today kill about five Americans per year; National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, 2020), whereas phobias about guns (which kill 20 times that number of Americans every day; Centers for Disease Control, 2020) are virtually nonexistent.¬†

## Learning Theory¬†

Phobias can be acquired through learned (also known as conditioned) associations. For example, direct experience with a traumatic event, such as Miguel being bitten by a swarm of spiders, can result in a specific phobia. Three different types of conditioning‚Äîclassical conditioning, operant conditioning, and observational learning‚Äîplay a role in the development and persistence of specific phobias.¬†

### Classical Conditioning

Classical conditioning is a powerful influence on thoughts, feelings, and behaviors because it occurs outside of conscious awareness. **Classical conditioning** occurs when an individual comes to associate two stimuli. The **neutral stimulus (NS)** does not elicit any response on its own. The **unconditioned stimulus (UCS)** produces an automatic response, one that does not require learning. This automatic response is called the **unconditioned response (UCR).** When a neutral stimulus (NS) is paired with an unconditioned stimulus (UCS), it starts to produce the same response as the unconditioned stimulus (UCS); this response is called the **conditioned response (CR).** The neutral stimulus (NS) then becomes known as the **conditioned stimulus (CS),** as it now produces a response because it is associated with the unconditioned stimulus (UCS).¬†

To illustrate the way classical conditioning can produce a specific phobia, let us walk through how a fear of dogs can develop. According to classical conditioning, if a stimulus that we have no particular reaction to, (the neutral stimulus [NS]), becomes associated with something that naturally creates fear (the unconditioned stimulus [UCS]), it generates an unconditioned response (UCR). In this way, the neutral stimulus (NS) becomes associated with the unconditioned stimulus (UCS) and the person learns to fear it as well, resulting in a conditioned response (CR).

#### _Classical Conditioning_

![Illustration of how classical conditioning can produce a dog phobia.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/uF7zNk4lQby3MwAhyRnEXA_05c158f36bf4450d9af9295dbed4aef1_ARDCAM04FG005-Classical-Conditioning.png?expiry=1733788800000&hmac=D75melEf6xG4m2rkS4T1Xc7uQKoHDMTCwPE7T_qifaw)

_Note_. Many specific phobias are learned through classical conditioning, when a neutral stimulus becomes associated with an unconditioned stimulus. After classical conditioning, the neutral stimulus becomes the conditioned stimulus, and it then generates the conditioned response.

Pairing a dog (NS) with the fear created by the pain of a dog bite (UCS), will form an association between dogs and a painful bite so that encountering other dogs in the future may elicit the same fear response. According to classical conditioning, the NS (dogs) becomes a conditioned stimulus (CS) and produces a conditioned response (CR) or a fear of dogs) similar to that elicited by the unconditioned stimulus, a dog bite (UCS), without being bitten by a dog. Now seeing any dog evokes the same response as a dog bite from a specific dog. Once people have learned to fear dogs, a¬† dog is no longer a neutral stimulus (NS) but a conditioned stimulus (CS), and the fear that comes from seeing dogs in the absence of being bitten, is a conditioned response (CR).¬†

### Operant Conditioning and the Role of Negative Reinforcement in Fear Learning

Many forms of classical conditioning require repeated pairings of the NS and the UCS, but fear learning is capable of creating an association after a single pairing. For example, a single dog bite that results in pain and fear is enough to create a conditioned fear association. Often, in the absence of new pairings of the UCS and CS, classically-conditioned responses weaken over time and the CS stops evoking the CR. Why, then, would a person with a dog phobia (who would avoid dogs whenever possible) continue to fear dogs if they never get bitten again?¬†

The enduring nature of conditioned phobias can be explained by **operant conditioning,** a type of learning in which behavioral change occurs as a result of the consequences of behavior. This means that the person associates their behavior with its consequences, in a process called **reinforcement.** With one type of reinforcement, **negative reinforcement,** we are likely to repeat behaviors that allow us to avoid or escape from an unpleasant stimulus. If people are able to escape the fearful experience of seeing the phobic stimulus, their avoidance behavior is reinforced and they are likely to continue avoiding the stimulus.¬† In the example of dog phobia, the person will continue to avoid dogs to avoid the feeling of fear. But because they never get the opportunity to have a pleasant interaction with a dog, their phobia persists.¬†

### Observational Learning

Other than direct experience with trauma, a fear response can also be acquired through **observational learning**. Observational learning is the acquisition of information, skills, or behavior through watching the performance of others, either directly or via such media as films and videos. The observational learning of a fear response can occur by observing another individual‚Äôs distress when faced with a fear-inducing stimulus (√ñst, 1991; √ñst & Hugdahl, 1981). For example, seeing a parent enduring painful electric shocks can create a fear of that experience in a child even though they did not feel the pain firsthand (Marin et al., 2020). Applying this example to phobias, seeing a person nearly drown can create a water phobia even in the absence of having a personal experience with nearly drowning.¬†

Vicarious learning of a fear response occurs when a fear is evoked without any exposure or experience (direct or indirect) to a fear-inducing stimulus. Rather, the fear response is acquired by hearing or reading about the fear-inducing stimulus‚Äîfor example, a person may acquire a fear of flying by viewing media coverage of a plane crash.¬†

Although it‚Äôs unethical to create phobias in psychological research, researchers have used lesser degrees of fear to demonstrate vicarious fear learning (Olsson and Phelps, 2004; Szczepanik et al., 2020). For example, in one study, researchers had pairs of friends act as participants. One member of each pair received electric shocks while the other watched. Both participants in each pair realized that the shocks were only being delivered when a yellow square was being shown on a computer screen. Not surprisingly, this led to the friend who was getting shocked showing a physiological fear response whenever they saw the yellow square. Afterwards, the friend who had been observing was shown the same yellow square and physiological measures of fear were taken. Like their friends, observers showed physiological fear responses when they saw the yellow square.

## Cultural Issues

As with other disorders, the diagnosis of specific phobia is influenced by cultural issues. A diagnosis of phobia should not be made in areas where specific objects or situations are feared by most people unless that fear is extreme and impairs daily functioning (WHO, 2019). The prevalence of certain phobias varies across countries based, in part, on the extent to which individuals in a culture have experience with a potentially phobic object or situation. The fear of flying, for example, is three times higher in higher income than lower income countries, owing to the fact that individuals in higher income countries are more likely to have the ability to travel by air (Wardenaar et al., 2017).

## Learning objective: Discuss the diagnostic criteria, prevalence, contributing factors, and cultural influences for each of the disorders that involve anxiety.

1. Diagnostic criteria: Though the diagnostic criteria for each disorder vary, they all involve the experience of anxiety that is more extreme than would be expected by societal standards. In addition, the level of anxiety is sufficient to cause distress, potential danger to self or others, and significant impairment in daily life, including difficulty with work, school, family, and friendships.
    
2. Prevalence: Anxiety disorders are the most common type of psychological disorder world-wide. Approximately 7% of individuals globally will experience an anxiety disorder sometime in their lives. The global lifetime prevalence of GAD, panic disorder, and specific phobia is 4.5%, 1.7%, and 7%, respectively. Women are approximately twice as likely as men to report experiencing an anxiety disorder.
    
3. Contributing factors: Though there may be small differences between disorders, anxiety disorders generally result from a combination of biological and environmental factors. Evidence suggests that there¬† is a heritable component to some anxiety disorders such that some individuals are biologically predisposed to experience anxiety. In addition, functioning in the areas of the brain known as the fear circuit plays a major role in the experience of anxiety.
    
    1. A variety of environmental factors can influence the development of anxiety disorders. Extreme or long-lasting stress can increase the likelihood that an individual will experience anxiety. In addition, classical and operant conditioning can operate to create anxious responses. Finally, cognitive distortions can affect the development of anxiety disorders. The experience of racial discrimination can uniquely impact the experience of anxiety, especially obsessive-compulsive disorder.
        
4. Cultural influences: Researchers have found that the experience of anxiety and the development of anxiety disorders differs between Western and non-Western cultures. For some disorders there are significant differences in the experience of anxiety such that in non-Western cultures, individuals experience physical manifestations of anxiety more so than in Western cultures.
    
    1. Many cultures also experience anxiety in ways that are culture-specific and clinicians must take cultural factors into account when assessing an individual‚Äôs experience of anxiety.
